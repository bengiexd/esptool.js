# esptool.js

``attention``: not work now.

##Setup

Using node-serialport is pretty easy because it is pretty basic. It provides you with the building block to make great things, it is not a complete solution - just a cog in the (world domination) machine.

**Special Notes**

* Support for Node.js version 0.8.x has been removed. Version 1.4.0 is the last version that supported node.js version 0.8.x.
* Currently support for Node.js version 0.11.x is dealing with an issue in the latest version of v. 0.11.13. We have confirmed things are fine with 0.11.10 and earlier, but not 0.11.11+.
